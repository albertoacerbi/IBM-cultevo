## Before sharing 

* Chapter 12: check + cross-references + captions numbering + references -> becomes 15

* Rename references chapter to 16-References.Rmd

## After sharing

* Delete previous_population in the code? Perhaps we can just say it makes the code clearer.

* Chapter 14: introduce birth/death processes

* Create a file with all the R code for execution?
